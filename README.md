# Rabin-Crptosystem
My primary programming language is Python, so I will make use of the Rabin Algorithmfor making an encryption and decryption program in Python. We are also going to usefew python libraries to make code easy as we have large mathematical operations. Thereare three inputs for Rabin 512 encryption and decryption 1 output for each of them respectively.



# About Rabin Cryptosystem
Rabin Cryptosystem is an public-key cryptosystem invented by Michael Rabin. It usesasymmetric key encryption for communicating between two parties and encrypting themessage.The Rabin encryption scheme is one of an existing workable asymmetric cryptosystemthat comes with nice cryptographic properties. For instance, it has low-cost encryptionof which the Rabin encryption is relatively fast to encrypt compared to the widely com-mercialized RSA cryptosystem, and it has been proven to be as difficult as the integerfactorization problem. On the other hand, the decryption of Rabinâ€™s scheme producesfour possible answers, which only one is correct. This four-to-one decryption setting ofthe Rabin decryption could lead to a decryption failure scenario since no indicator forselecting the correct plaintext is given. We revisit the Rabin cryptosystem and then aspire to furnish a new design aiming forefficient, secure and practical Rabin-like cryptosystem.
  1. Improves the performance without plaintext padding mechanisms or sendingextra bits during encryption and decryption processes.
  2. The plaintext is uniquely decrypted without decryption failure.
  3. Improve decryption efficiency by using only one modular exponentiation.
  4. A decryption key using a single prime number.
  5.It has sufficient large plaintext space.
